= 'IntLang' - a Truffle Tree-sitter starter

This project is a small template for:

- a https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/[Truffle] language
- written in Kotlin (packaged with Gradle)
- that uses a https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/[tree-sitter] grammar

It parses an int, and returns it - the rest, as they say, is an exercise left to the reader!

== Pre-requisites:

Only tested on Linux thus far - testing on other platforms welcome.

Ensure you have the following installed on your system - most likely, through your usual package manager:

- GraalVM CE 22+
- `tree-sitter-cli`
- `clang`
